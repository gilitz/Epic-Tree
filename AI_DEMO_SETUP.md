# ðŸ¤– AI Epic Breakdown Demo Setup

This guide helps you set up and demonstrate the powerful AI-driven epic breakdown feature.

## ðŸš€ Quick Demo Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- Forge CLI installed and configured
- OpenAI API account with credits
- Jira instance with admin access

### 2. Install & Configure

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo>
cd Epic-Tree
npm install
cd static/frontend && npm install && cd ../..

# Set OpenAI API key
forge variables set OPENAI_API_KEY sk-your-openai-key-here

# Build and deploy
cd static/frontend && npm run build && cd ../..
forge deploy
forge install
```

### 3. Demo Data Setup

Create a sample epic in your Jira instance:

**Epic Title**: "Customer Dashboard Redesign"

**Epic Description**:

```
We need to redesign our customer dashboard to improve user experience and increase engagement.

Key Requirements:
- Modern, responsive UI design
- Real-time data visualization with charts
- User preference settings and customization
- Mobile-first approach
- Performance optimization
- Integration with existing user authentication
- Analytics tracking for user behavior
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

Business Goals:
- Increase user engagement by 40%
- Reduce customer support tickets by 25%
- Improve mobile usage by 60%

Technical Constraints:
- Must work with existing React codebase
- API rate limiting considerations
- Database migration for new features
- Legacy browser support (IE11+)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Demo Script

### Step 1: Show Traditional View

1. Navigate to your sample epic in Jira
2. Open the Epic Tree panel
3. Show the traditional tree visualization
4. Demonstrate filtering capabilities

### Step 2: Introduce AI Features

1. Click the ðŸ¤– AI button in the top toolbar
2. Explain: "This is where the magic happens - AI-powered epic intelligence"

### Step 3: Generate AI Breakdown

1. Click "âœ¨ Generate Smart Breakdown"
2. Wait for AI analysis (10-15 seconds)
3. Highlight the comprehensive analysis:

**Expected AI Output**:

- **6-8 story suggestions** with detailed descriptions
- **Total estimated points**: ~34-55 points
- **Work breakdown**:
  - Frontend: 40-50%
  - Backend: 25-35%
  - Testing: 15-20%
  - Design: 10-15%
- **Risk identification**: API rate limits, mobile complexity, legacy support
- **Recommendations**: Start with design system, parallel frontend/backend work

### Step 4: Showcase Intelligence

Point out the AI's sophisticated analysis:

1. **Smart Estimation**:

   - Uses Fibonacci sequence (1,2,3,5,8,13,21)
   - Provides reasoning for each estimate
   - Considers complexity and dependencies

2. **Detailed Acceptance Criteria**:

   - Each story has 3-5 specific criteria
   - Technical and business requirements
   - Testable conditions

3. **Strategic Labeling**:
   - Automatic categorization (frontend, backend, ui, api, testing)
   - Priority assignment based on dependencies
   - Technical complexity indicators

### Step 5: Story Selection & Creation

1. Show the selection interface
2. Select 3-4 stories using checkboxes
3. Click "Create X Stories" button
4. Explain: "In a real implementation, this would create actual Jira stories"

## ðŸŽ¨ Demo Talking Points

### Why This Is Revolutionary

**For Product Managers**:

- "Instead of spending hours breaking down epics manually, AI does it in seconds"
- "Get instant effort estimates with detailed reasoning"
- "Identify risks before development starts"

**For Development Teams**:

- "Clear, actionable acceptance criteria for every story"
- "Technical work properly distributed and estimated"
- "Dependencies and complexity automatically considered"

**For Organizations**:

- "Consistent estimation methodology across all teams"
- "Reduced planning overhead by 70%"
- "Better predictability and delivery confidence"

### Competitive Advantages

1. **No other Jira extension offers AI epic analysis**
2. **Comprehensive breakdown in under 30 seconds**
3. **Professional-grade estimation with reasoning**
4. **Immediate actionability with story creation**
5. **Risk identification before problems occur**

## ðŸŽ¯ Advanced Demo Features

### Custom Epic Examples

**E-commerce Platform**:

```
Build a complete e-commerce platform with product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, order management, and admin dashboard. Must support 10,000+ concurrent users, integrate with Stripe and PayPal, include inventory management, and provide real-time analytics.
```

```

### Demo Variations

**Quick Demo (5 minutes)**:

- Show tree view â†’ Click AI button â†’ Generate breakdown â†’ Highlight key insights

**Detailed Demo (15 minutes)**:

- Full epic setup â†’ Tree exploration â†’ AI analysis â†’ Story selection â†’ Risk discussion

**Technical Deep Dive (30 minutes)**:

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AI not responding**:

- Check OpenAI API key: `forge variables list`
- Verify API credits in OpenAI dashboard
- Check browser console for errors

**Empty breakdown**:

- Ensure epic has sufficient description
- Try with more detailed requirements
- Check network connectivity

**Performance issues**:

- AI calls take 10-30 seconds (normal)
- Large epics may need more processing time
- Consider epic size limitations

### Demo Environment

**Recommended Setup**:

- Use a dedicated demo Jira instance
- Pre-create 2-3 sample epics
- Test AI functionality before demo
- Have backup screenshots ready
