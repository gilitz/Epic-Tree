# Privacy Policy for Epic Tree

**Last updated: June 2025**

## Overview

Epic Tree is a Jira Forge application that helps visualize and manage epic hierarchies within your Atlassian Jira instance. This privacy policy explains how we handle data when you use our application.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What Data We Access

Epic Tree accesses the following data from your Jira instance:

- Issue data (summaries, descriptions, status, priority, assignees)
- Project information
- User information (for assignee dropdowns)
- Custom field data (story points, epic links, sprints)
- Issue relationships and hierarchies

### How We Use Your Data

- **Visualization**: Display epic trees and issue hierarchies
- **Filtering**: Enable filtering by various issue attributes
- **Editing**: Allow inline editing of issue fields

### Data Storage and Security

- **No External Storage**: Epic Tree does not store your Jira data outside of Atlassian's infrastructure
- **Atlassian Forge Platform**: All data processing occurs within Atlassian's secure Forge platform
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: We do not share your data with third parties
- **Temporary Processing**: Data is only held in memory during active sessions

### Data Flow

**Data Path:**

1. Your Jira Instance → Atlassian Forge Platform → Epic Tree App
2. Processing occurs entirely within Atlassian's infrastructure
3. No data leaves Atlassian's secure environment
4. No external subprocessors or third-party services are used

**Geographic Data Residency:**

- Data is processed in the same geographic region as your Atlassian instance
- Follows Atlassian's data residency policies
- No cross-border data transfers outside of Atlassian's infrastructure

## Permissions

Epic Tree requires the following Jira permissions:

- `read:jira-work` - To read issue data and project information
- `write:jira-work` - To update issue fields and relationships
- `read:jira-user` - To access user information for assignee functionality

## Data Retention

- Epic Tree does not retain your data beyond the active session
- All data access is real-time from your Jira instance
- No logs or caches of your issue data are maintained

## Your Rights

As a user, you have the right to:

- **Access**: Request information about what personal data we process
- **Rectification**: Request correction of inaccurate personal data
- **Erasure**: Request deletion of your personal data
- **Data Portability**: Request a copy of your data in a structured format
- **Object**: Object to processing of your personal data
- **Control**: Control which data Epic Tree can access through Jira permissions

### Data Subject Requests

To exercise your rights or make a data subject request:

2. **Include** your Jira instance URL and specific request details
3. **We will respond** within 30 days of receiving your request
