## Requirements

See [Set up Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/set-up-forge/) for instructions to get set up.

## ðŸ”§ Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
cd static/frontend
npm install
cd ../..
```

### 2. Configure AI Features (Optional)

To enable AI-powered epic breakdown:

1. Get an OpenAI API key from [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Set the environment variable:

```bash
forge variables set OPENAI_API_KEY your_api_key_here
```

**Note**: AI features are optional. The extension works perfectly without AI - you'll just see the tree visualization and filtering capabilities.

### 3. Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build the frontend
cd static/frontend
npm run build
cd ../..

# Deploy the app
forge deploy

# Install on your Jira site
forge install
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage

1. **Navigate to any Epic** in your Jira instance
2. **Open the Epic Tree panel** on the right side
3. **View the tree visualization** of all child issues and subtasks
4. **Use filters** to focus on specific assignees, statuses, priorities, or labels
5. **Toggle the AI button (ðŸ¤–)** to access Smart Epic Breakdown
6. **Generate AI suggestions** by clicking "âœ¨ Generate Smart Breakdown"
